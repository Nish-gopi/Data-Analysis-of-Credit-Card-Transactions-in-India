## About the Dataset:
This dataset contains insights into a collection of credit card transactions made in India, offering a comprehensive look at the spending habits of Indians across the nation. From the Gender and Card type used to carry out each transaction to which city saw the highest spending, and even what kind of expenses were made, this dataset paints an overall picture of how money is being spent in India today. With its variety of variables, researchers have an opportunity to uncover deeper trends in customer spending and interesting correlations between data points that can serve as invaluable business intelligence. Whether you're interested in learning more about customer preferences or exploring unbiased data analysis techniques, this data will surely provide insight beyond what one could anticipate. The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/analyzing-credit-card-spending-habits-in-india

## Purpose of the Project:
The primary objective of this project is to gain actionable insights from credit card transaction data in India. By analyzing various factors such as card types, expense types, gender, and city, we aim to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations that can inform strategic decisions for financial institutions, businesses, and researchers.

## Leveraging SQL for Analysis:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for analyzing structured data stored in databases. Using SQL in this project, we can efficiently query, manipulate, and analyze the credit card transaction data to derive meaningful insights. SQL offers many functions and capabilities, making it ideal for data exploration, aggregation, and visualization tasks.

## Proportion Calculation: 
**(Question 7)**
In Question 7, we calculate the proportion of male and female transactions by dividing the count of each gender by the total number of transactions. This proportion represents the relative frequency of transactions attributed to each gender. For example, a proportion of 0.5251 for females means that approximately 52.51% of transactions in the dataset are attributed to females, while a proportion of 0.4749 for males indicates that males account for approximately 47.49% of transactions.
## Percentage Contribution Calculation: 
**(Question 13)**
In Question 13, we compute the percentage contribution of total spends in each city by dividing the total spend in each city by the overall total spend across all cities and then multiplying by 100. This calculation reveals the proportion of total credit card spending attributed to each city. For instance, a percentage contribution of 14.00% for a city indicates that it contributes 14% of the total credit card spending recorded in the dataset.
## Percentage Ratio Calculation: 
**(Question 16)**
Question 16 involves computing the percentage ratio of spending for the gold card type in each city. We calculate this ratio by dividing the total amount spent using gold cards in a city by the total amount spent in that city for all card types. This ratio provides insight into the proportion of total spending in a city that is attributed to gold card transactions. For example, a ratio of 0.0033299 for a city indicates that only approximately 0.33% of the total spending in that city is done using gold cards.
## Percentage Female Contribution Calculation: 
**(Question 18)**
In Question 18, we determine the percentage contribution of spending by females for each expense type. This calculation involves dividing the total amount spent by females on a particular expense type by the overall total amount spent on that expense type across all genders. The resulting percentage represents the relative share of spending by females in each expense category. For example, a percentage of 0.6394588 for the "Bills" expense type indicates that approximately 63.95% of the total spending on bills is attributed to female cardholders.
These calculations provide valuable insights into the distribution, contribution, and relative proportions of various factors within the dataset, aiding in interpreting and understanding the analysis results.

## Conclusion:
Through this comprehensive analysis of credit card transactions in India, we have uncovered valuable insights into consumer spending behavior, trends, and patterns. By leveraging SQL for data analysis, we have gained actionable insights for financial institutions, businesses, and researchers to inform strategic decisions. Moving forward, these insights can be used to optimize marketing strategies, improve customer targeting, and enhance overall business performance in the Indian market.
